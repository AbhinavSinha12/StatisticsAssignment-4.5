Assignment 4.5

Problem Statement 1:
A die marked A to E is rolled 50 times. Find the probability of getting a “D” exactly 5
times.

Here, n = 50, 

n - k = 45
k = 5


The probability of success = probability of getting a “D”= s = 1/5

Hence, the probability of failure = probability of not getting a “D” = 1 - s = 4/5.
